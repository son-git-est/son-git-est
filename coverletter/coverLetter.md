Dear Sir/Madam,

I am Son Pham, currently working as Revenue Auditor at SkyCity.
Part of the job requires me to work with data where I utilize my knowledge of
EXCEL VBA to clean, process, and analyze data.
It's where I grow my interests in coding.
At the moment, I am learning HTML, CSS, mySQL, and JAVA.
I am still on the track of getting all this knowledge, and I do have some achivements.
I am looking for an oppotunity where I can learn more, and develop my coding skills.
I will be a keen learner, and will surely deliver my best to meet any expectation.

I am looking forward to hearing from you.
Best Regards,
Son Pham
