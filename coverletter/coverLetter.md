**Dear Sir/Madam**,

I am Son Pham, currently working as Revenue Auditor at Skycity.
Part of the job requires me to work with data. I utilize my knowledge of EXCEL VBA
to clean, process, and analyze data to produce gaming results - these are distributed
business wide.
Here, I grow my good interests in coding and the desire to create things rather
than simply processing what's given to me.
Now, I am learning HTML, CSS, mySQL, and JAVA, still on the track of getting hold
of all this knowledge.
I am looking for an opportunity where I can learn more and develop my coding skills.
I will be a keen learner and will surely deliver my best to meet any
expectation, including my own.

I am looking forward to hearing from you.
Best Regards,
Son Pham
