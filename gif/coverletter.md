Dear Sir/Madam,

I am Son Pham, currently working as Revenue Auditor at Skycity.
Part of the job requires me to work with data where I utilize my knowledge of 
excel VBA to clean, process, and analyze data. It's where I grow interests on
coding. At the moment, I am learning CSS, HTML, mySQL, and JAVA.
I am still on the track of getting hold of all this knowledge, already have 
some achivements.
I am looking for an oppotunity where I can learn more, and develop my coding skills.
I will be a keen learner, and will surely deliver my best to meet any expectation.

I am looking forward to hearing from you.
Best Regards,
Son Pham
