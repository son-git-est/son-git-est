# Hello, I am **Son Pham**.

⭐⭐⭐ coding enthusiast and hobby photographer⭐⭐⭐

Graduated with Honours in Finance, who would think my career is going to skew toward an entirely different direction.

I've been always excellent at working with numbers, so I chose to study Finance.

However, as time goes by, I understand that from deep in my heart, I want more.
